# JSON Comparator 

The JSON Object Comparator Tool allows you to compare two JSON objects with the same structure/key-values and obtain a similarity percentage between them. Additionally, it highlights any differences between the objects, providing detailed information on where these discrepancies lie.

## Features
Similarity Calculation: Computes a similarity percentage between two JSON objects with identical structures.
Difference Highlighting: Identifies and details differences between the two JSON objects.

## Usage Example
An example demonstrating how to use the tool is provided in the accompanying notebook. This notebook utilizes two sample JSON objects, which are also included.

## Use Cases
LLM Efficiency Analysis: If you are working with Large Language Models (LLMs) and need to assess their efficiency in retrieving and populating information within a JSON object, you can use a control JSON object and compare it with the one populated by the LLM.
